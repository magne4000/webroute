title: Standalone Apps
---

Webroutes are very versatile, and can be used as standalone apps. Here we cover some tips for getting webroute apps up and running with various runtimes.

---

## Prerequisites

The below assumes you have some root handler for requests, which may or may not perform routing (it's up to you).

```ts title="example-root-handler.ts"
const appRoutes = { myRoute, myOtherRoute };

// Create an array of { path, method, payload } for AppRoutes
const routeList = Object.values(appRoutes).map(Route.normalise);

const router = createRadixRouter(routeList);

const app = (request: Request) => {
  const handler = router.match(request);

  return handler?.(request) ?? new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
};
```

## Node

While Node has supported the web standard `Request` and `Response` classes from v21, it does not provide a standard way to access an incoming HTTP `Request`.

Until node provides a built-in WinterCG-compliant server, one should use [`@hono/node-server`](https://github.com/honojs/node-server) which converts the traditional node Request/Responses to the web-standard counterpart, on the fly.

```ts
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";

serve({ fetch: app }); // <- Provides us with `Request` and `Response` in node.
```

## Bun

```ts
Bun.serve({ fetch: app });
```

## Deno

```ts
Deno.serve(app);
```

## Cloudflare Workers

The `workerd` runtime that Cloudflare Workers utilise expects a default export with a `fetch` property.

```ts
export default {
  fetch: app,
};
```

<Accordions>
	<Accordion title="What about `env` and `ctx`">
		Cloudflare also exposes environment bindings and context via two additional paremeters, `env` and `ctx`. To access these within our routes we can simply assign `env` and/or `ctx` to globally accessible variables.

    	```ts title="global.ts"
    	export let env: Env;
    	export let ctx: Ctx;
    	```

    	```ts title="index.ts"
    	import { env } from "./global"

    	export default {
    		fetch: (req, _env, _ctx) => {
    			env = _env
    			ctx = _ctx
    		}
    	}
    	```

    	```ts title="my-route.ts"
    	import { env } from "./global"
    	// ...
    	const myVar = env.MY_VAR
    	//...
    	```
    </Accordion>
