`webroute` only concerns itself with routes and endpoints. It agnostic to how you might actually build, run or deploy an app.

In many cases this is sufficient, for example when developing serverless functions. However sometimes we require greater orchestration, or integration with other runtimes and frameworks.

Here we will explore some ways our `webroute`s can be connected to these existing runtimes and frameworks.

## Full Stack Frameworks

In full stack frameworks, filesystem routers typically handle routing for us, and work with `webroute`s simply and idiomatically.

### Next.js et al.

`webroute` works natively with `nextjs` and similar filesystem routers. Simply export each route in it's designated file.

```ts title="posts/route.ts"
export const GET = myRoute
```

<Callout>
Bear in mind nextjs file routing determines the HTTP method and path, so specifying a `webroute` path or method is redundant and will have no effect.
</Callout>

## Web Frameworks and Runtimes

_The below assumes you have some root handler for requests, which may or may not perform routing._

```ts title="example-root-handler.ts"
const handleRequest = (req: Request): Response => {
	// ...
}
```

### Node

While Node has supported the web standard `Request` and `Response` classes from v21, it does not provide a standard way to access an incoming HTTP `Request`. 

Until node provides a built-in WinterCG-compliant server, one should use [`@hono/node-server`](https://github.com/honojs/node-server) which converts the traditional node Request/Responses to the web-standard counterpart, on the fly.

```ts
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server'

serve({ fetch: handleRequest }) // <- Provides us with `Request` and `Response` in node.
```

### Bun

```ts
Bun.serve({ fetch: handleRequest })
```

### Deno

```ts
Deno.serve(handleRequest)
```

### Cloudflare Workers

The `workerd` runtime that Cloudflare Workers utilise expects a default export with a `fetch` property.

```ts
export default {
	fetch: handleRequest
}
```

<Accordions>
	<Accordion title="What about `env` and `ctx`">
		Cloudflare also exposes environment bindings and context via two additional paremeters, `env` and `ctx`. To access these within our routes we can simply assign `env` and/or `ctx` to globally accessible variables.

		```ts title="global.ts"
		export let env: Env;
		export let ctx: Ctx;
		```

		```ts title="index.ts"
		import { env } from "./global"

		export default {
			fetch: (req, _env, _ctx) => {
				env = _env
				ctx = _ctx
			}
		}
		```

		```ts title="my-route.ts"
		import { env } from "./global"
		// ...
		const myVar = env.MY_VAR
		//...
		```
	</Accordion>
</Accordions>
