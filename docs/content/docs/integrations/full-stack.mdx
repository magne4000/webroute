title: Full-Stack Frameworks
---

Webroute is particularly suited for full-stack or meta-frameworks like `Next.js`, `Remix`, `SolidStart` and `SvelteKit`.

By default, these frameworks offer a minimal and unopinionated approach to building and using APIs. When reaching for more complex functionality though, we are often forced to use a monolithic framework like `Hono` or `Express`. However, this defeats the purpose and benefits of using filesystem routing.

## Introduction

Since each webroute is a self-contained and web-standard request
handler, all we need to do is export our webroute from a route handler
file.

As such, webroutes work in many places. Below, we provide basic examples of using webroute within your favourite full-stack frameworks.

## `Next.js`

We can export routes from `Next.js` route handler files like so.

```ts title="api/foo/route.ts"
export const GET = route().handle(() => {
  return "OK";
});
```

## `Remix`

```ts title="app/routes/my-route.ts"
const myRoute = route().handle(() => {
  return "OK";
});

export const loader = ({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => myRoute(request);
```

## `SolidStart`

```ts title="routes/api/foo.ts"
export const GET = route().handle(() => {
  return "OK";
});
```

## `SvelteKit`

```ts title="src/routes/api/foo/+server.ts"
const myRoute = route().handle(() => {
  return "OK";
});

export const GET = ({ request }: RequestHandler) => myRoute(request);
```
