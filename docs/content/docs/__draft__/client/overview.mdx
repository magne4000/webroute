The `@webroute/client` package provides a simple and flexible abstraction for interacting with any REST API type-safely.

It works with any fetching library of your choice and is designed to expedite client-side development as well as reducing errors and mistakes, by better enforcing your API contract.

## Define App

We can arbitrarily define our API schema for a typed client via the `DefineApp` type.

```ts
import { DefineApp } from "@webroute/client";

type App = DefineApp<{
  "GET /posts": {
    Query: { limit?: number };
  };
}>;
```

## Typed Client

The typed client is an extremely lightweight, so-called "headless" client-side interface for your API. It is entirely unopinionated about how fetching is done and merely wires up end-to-end type safety, without getting in your way.

```ts twoslash title="react-app/api-client.ts"
// ---cut-start---
import { DefineApp, createTypedClient } from "@webroute/client";

type App = DefineApp<{
  "GET /posts": {
    Query: { limit?: number };
  };
}>;
// ---cut-end---
// Create a lightweight client instance
const client = createTypedClient<App>()({
  fetcher: async (config, opts: { foo: string }) => {
    return { id: "123" };
  },
});

// Each API operation is represented as a single, flat key
// in the form `{METHOD} {path}`
const getPost = client("GET /posts");

const result = getPost({ query: { limit: 12 } }, { foo: "bar" });
```

Our custom fetcher is responsible for executing our request and parsing our response, if need be. It allows for flexible options and return types.

```ts
import { createUrl } from "@webroute/client";

const myFetcher = async (
  // Contains info about path, method, body etc.
  config,

  // Any additional parameters are exposed via the client instance
  // and fully typed.
  opts: AxiosRequestConfig
) => {
  const { path, method, body, params, query } = config;

  // ... Fetch using any method...
};
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title='Creating URLs more easily with createUrl()'>

It can be tedious to convert the `path`, `query` and `params` into a corresoponding url. If you require this functionality, you can use the `createUrl` utility. If you need more custom functionality, you can always roll your own.

```ts
// ...myFetcher
// `createUrl` is a small helper for combining the path pattern with path and query params.
const url = createUrl(config);

// e.g. use axios
const res = await axios({
  url,
  method: config.method,
  data: config.body,
  ...opts,
});

return res;
// ...myFetcher
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Schema Types

The `App` definition is a very simple type which we can directly reference to get information on our routes `body`, `output` etc.

```ts
const operation = "GET /posts" satistfies keyof App // an API operation
type Endpoint = App[typeof operation];

type Query = Endpoint["Query"];
type Params = Endpoint["Params"];
type Body = Endpoint["Body"];
type Output = Endpoint["Output"];
```

This is helpful for defining our own fetching functions or wrapping typed-client functionality.

```ts
export const getPost = async (params: Params): Promise<Result> => {
  // ...
};
```
