Webroute makes building fully-fledged standalone HTTP routes easy. The end result can be run anywhere web standard `Request` and `Response` are supported, including without any router.

Conceptually, `route` moves middleware and I/O validation out of the router and into the route itself. This enables powerful composition and each route becomes incredibly portable.

## Introduction

The utility of this approach becomes clear when used with `nextjs` or other filesystem routers, for example:

```ts twoslash
// ---cut-start---
import { route } from "@webroute/route";
import { z } from "zod";
// ---cut-end---
export const GET = route()
  // Specify middleware, returning data will update the `state` field later
  .use((req) => {
    return { userId: "123" };
  })

  // Specify any input and output validators...
  .body(z.object({ name: z.string() }))

  // Handle the request...
  .handle(async (req, { state, parse }) => {
    const { userId } = state;
    const { name } = await parse("body"); // Lazily validate body

    return { ok: true }; // Sends as JSON
    // or: return Response.json(...)
  });

// Just a regular request handler
const response = await GET(new Request("https://google.com"));
```

And you could use this exact same route handler with Hono too.

```ts
app.get("/post", (c) => GET(c.req.raw));
```

By packaging the validation and middleware (and more) with the route itself, it becomes incredibly portable, and you'll find your applications actually become _simpler_ too.
