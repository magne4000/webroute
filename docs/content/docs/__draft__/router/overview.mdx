import { Install } from "@/components/ui/install";

<Install name="@webroute/router" />

`@webroute/router` exports several routers which simply match handlers to an incoming request.

All routers have the shape:

```ts
export type RequestRouter<T> = {
  match: (request: Request) => T | undefined;
  matchAll: (request: Request) => T[];
};
```

## Example Usage

```ts
const router = createRouter([
  {
    path: "/foo",
    methods: ["GET"],
    payload: () => "1", // Handler can be any function
  },
  {
    path: "/bar",
    methods: ["POST"],
    payload: () => "2", // Handler can be any function
  },
]);

const handler = router.match(
  new Request("https://myapi.com/bar", { method: "post" })
);
const result = handler?.(); // "2"
```

## Routers

In most cases, you will want to use the faster `radix` router which uses the `radix` algorithm to quickly find route handlers.

### Radix Router

```ts
import { createRadixRouter } from "@webroute/router";

const router = createRadixRouter([
  {
    path: "/foo",
    methods: ["GET"],
    payload: () => "Some handler", // Handler can be any function
  },
]);
```

### Linear Router

However, in some instances – like if route registration order is important – you might want to use the linear router.

```ts
import { createLinearRouter } from "@webroute/router";

const router = createLinearRouter([
  {
    path: "/foo",
    methods: ["GET"],
    payload: () => "Some handler", // Handler can be any function
  },
]);
```
