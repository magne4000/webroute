description: Using OpenAPI specs to define API contracts

OpenAPI enables producing declarative descriptions of our APIs, independent of their implementation. This has several benefits, including self-documentation and making schema and endpoint information available across app boundaries.

We can utilise webroute packages to both define and consume OpenAPIs, on the client and server side.

## OpenAPI Spec Definitions

Out of the box, we can produce a fairly comprehensive OpenAPI spec of our API by leveraging the `@weboute/oas` package.

```ts
import { Route } from "@webroute/route";
import { createSpec } from "@webroute/oas";

const routes = Object.values(appRoutes).map(Route.normalise);

const spec = createSpec(routes);
```

Here, we've derived an entire OpenAPI spec from our app. Noticably, though, our schema definitions missing. For our OpenAPI spec to understand our schema validators which we've provided to `.params()`, `.body()` etc., we must provide a "formatter" to do so.

### Schema Formatters

Hand-rolling a schema converter is no small feat. Luckily, webroute provides converters for most popular schema libraries.

The `@webroute/schema` library contains functionality for working with schema libraries. One such utility helps convert any schema into JSONSchema form, compatible with our OpenAPI schema.

{/* TODO: Is this import right? */}

```ts
import { ZodJsonSchemaFormatter } from "@webroute/oas/zod";

const spec = createSpec(routes, {
  formatter: ZodJsonSchemaFormatter(), // <--
});
```

This approach supports using multiple schema libraries at once, and dynamically formatting them with the corresponding formatter function.

Now our generated OpenAPI spec will have all schema information too.

## Customisation

The return `spec` value can be customised as much as you want, but it can be cumbersome to modify our OpenAPI spec in this way.

We can specify fine-grained OpenAPI-related metadata by using the `OAS` export.

```ts
import { OAS } from "@webroute/oas";

const OASUserSchema = OAS.Schema(UserSchema, {
  id: "User",
});

const UserAsParam = OAS.Param(OASUserSchema, {
  // ...param-specific configuration
});
```

Bear in mind each customisation is entirely optional.
